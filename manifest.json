  "long_description": "Your AI assistant is a powerful partner, capable of processing immense amounts of text and code. But when it comes to the visual web, it's flying blind. It can't see the layout of a competitor's landing page, the design of a complex dashboard, or the look of your latest prototype. Glasses MCP gives it sight. It's a simple tool that allows your AI to request a perfect, device-specific screenshot of any website. It's not just about taking pictures; it's about giving your AI the context it's been missing, turning the visual web into a resource it can finally understand and interact with.",
